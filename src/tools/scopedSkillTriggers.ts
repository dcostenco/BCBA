/**
 * Prompt triggers declared by a skill, in its own frontmatter.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Prompt-keyword routing matches against the PUBLIC, unauthenticated routing
 * table (`/_internal/skills-routing.json`). A private account or team skill can
 * never be listed there — the name and its trigger words would be world
 * readable — so scoped skills were delivered to disk and then never surfaced by
 * any prompt. They were installed and inert.
 *
 * The fix keeps the trigger exactly as private as the body that declares it:
 *
 *     ---
 *     name: my-skill
 *     description: …
 *     prompt_triggers:
 *       - "\\binvoice\\b.{0,20}\\bsubmit\\b"
 *       - "quarterly close"
 *     ---
 *
 * The body already reaches this machine through the AUTHENTICATED manifest and
 * is cached as `skill:<name>`, so the triggers ride along with it. Nothing new
 * is transmitted, no schema changes, and matching stays on-device — the user's
 * prompt still never leaves the machine.
 *
 * SAFETY: these patterns come from user-authored content and are compiled on the
 * startup path, where a pathological regex would hang every session for everyone
 * the skill is shared with. Limits below are deliberately strict, and anything
 * rejected is reported rather than silently dropped — a trigger that never fires
 * is indistinguishable from the bug this file fixes.

/**
 * Reject patterns that can backtrack catastrophically.
 *
 * RULE: a group may not be quantified. Exponential backtracking needs the
 * engine to try many different ways to split the SAME substring, and in
 * practice that requires a repeated group — `(a+)+`, `(a|aa)+`, `(\w+\s?)*`,
 * `(.*a){20}`. Refusing `)` followed by `+`, `*` or `{n,m}` kills the whole
 * family with one check that is trivial to read and cannot be argued with.
 *
 * This replaced a shape-matching heuristic that only caught the textbook
 * `(a+)+`. Measured against it, `((a+))+` slipped through nested parens and
 * `(a|aa)+` — the canonical example — slipped through because it contains no
 * inner quantifier at all; the latter took 447ms on 36 characters and grows
 * exponentially, so a trigger inside the 200-char cap could hang startup for
 * every member of a team it is shared with. JavaScript has no regex timeout:
 * once a match begins there is no way to interrupt it, which is why this must
 * be refused BEFORE compilation rather than bounded at runtime.
 *
 * Cost: a legitimate quantified group must be rewritten. Every trigger shape
 * seen in practice — word boundaries, proximity via `.{0,n}`, alternation
 * without repetition — is unaffected.
