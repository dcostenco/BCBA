/**
 * session_route_prompt — mid-session skill routing.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS CLOSES (2026-08-12). Skill routing runs at session_bootstrap,
 * which by instruction happens on the first turn. Long sessions are where the
 * work actually is: an eight-hour session was asked six times for a UI/UX
 * review, and even after the routing table learned those phrasings, nothing
 * could deliver the skill — the ask arrived at turn ~530 and routing had run
 * at turn 1. The agent substituted source-grep assertions for rendered
 * evidence and shipped six reactive patches.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A TOOL AND NOT AUTOMATIC. An MCP server never sees the user's
 * prompt; the protocol only carries what a tool call carries. Truly automatic
 * per-prompt injection needs a HOST hook, which the operator has ruled out.
 * This is the honest approximation: the model passes the prompt, we match it
 * on-device and return only what is genuinely new.
 *
 * CHEAP BY CONSTRUCTION, because an instruction to call it every turn is only
 * affordable if the common answer is nearly free:
 *   - the overwhelmingly common result is "no new skills", a one-line reply;
 *   - `loaded` lets the caller declare what it already has, so a skill is
 *     never re-injected and a repeated call costs nothing;
 *   - bodies are capped, so a pathological match cannot dump the budget.
 *
 * The prompt is matched ON DEVICE against the same table and the same scoped
 * frontmatter triggers session_bootstrap uses. It is never transmitted.
