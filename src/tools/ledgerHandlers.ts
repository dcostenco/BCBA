/**
 * Session Memory Handlers (v2.0 — StorageBackend Refactor)
 *
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * v2.0 CHANGES IN THIS FILE (Step 1: Pure Refactor)
 *
 * BEFORE: All handlers called supabasePost/Get/Rpc/Patch/Delete directly.
 * AFTER:  All handlers call StorageBackend methods via `getStorage()`.
 *
 * This refactor changes ZERO behavior. Every method call maps 1:1 to
 * the same Supabase API call (see src/storage/supabase.ts for mapping).
 *
 * WHY: This enables Step 2 (SQLite local mode) — once SqliteStorage
 * implements the same interface, the handlers work with both backends
 * without any code changes.
